## Instructions

In this challenge you are required to create a function that will generate a word search puzzle
containing names of ten randomly selected JLP locations.

The grid will be 14 X 14.

The function returns an array/list of 196 letters.
The first 14 elements represents the first row of the grid, the next 14 elements the 2nd row of the grid etc.


The words hidden in the word search may be arranged horizontally, vertically or diagonally and read in any direction.

The list of locations can be found [here](https://github.com/mattTea/WordSearch-Challenge23/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/words.kt)

## Bonus

For bonus points, create a function that reads a word search grid (formatted into an array of 196 letters)
and finds all of the JLP locations in the grid.
